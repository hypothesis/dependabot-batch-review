# depandabot-batch-review

CLI tool for batch review of
[Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) PRs across all
of a user or organization's repositories.

## Introduction

This tool enables efficient review and merging of Dependabot PRs across the
repositories in an organization (or user account).

It is built on the GitHub [GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql).

## Installation

1. Install [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

2. Clone this repository and install Python dependencies with:

   ```
   pipenv install --dev
   ```

## Usage

First generate a [GitHub access
token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
with permission to read and merge PRs in the organization you want to query.
Then in this repository run:

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$TOKEN
pipenv run review [organization]
```

This will query for open PRs from Dependabot in the organization `organization`,
which can also be a GitHub username. It will group the updates by package name,
then go through each package in alphabetical order, show a summary of the PRs
updating that package and prompt for an action.

For each package it will show the name, version ranges of updates and status of
continuous integration checks. At this point you can then choose to review
release notes for the update, merge all PRs in the group that have passed CI
checks, or see individual PRs in the group.

```shellsession
$ pipenv run review hypothesis
Finding open Dependabot PRs for user or organization hypothesisâ€¦
Found 11 PRs for 7 dependencies

1 updates for dependency @babel/core:
Versions: 
  @babel/core 7.17.9 -> 7.17.10
Check status: 1 passed, 0 failed
[m]erge all passing, [s]kip, [q]uit, [r]eview notes, [l]ist PR urls:
```

### Grouped updates

When using Dependabot's [grouped
updates](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-30-grouped-version-updates-for-dependabot-public-beta/)
feature, this tool will treat the group name of a PR like a package name for the
purposes of grouping PRs across repositories.

If for example you had configured a group called "babel" in multiple
repositories which matched all npm dependencies whose name matches the pattern
"@babel/", then this tool would group together all the PRs that updated the
"babel" group across different repositories.

```shellsession
1 updates for group babel:
Versions:
  @babel/preset-typescript 7.22.15 -> 7.23.0
  @babel/core 7.22.17 -> 7.23.0
Checks: 1 passed
```

In this example, there is one PR updating a group called "babel", which updates
two different packages.

### Filtering updates

There are several options to filter PRs:

- `--label <label>` finds PRs with a specific label. By default Dependabot adds
  a label for the language (eg. "javascript").
- `--repo-filter <pattern>` finds PRs only in repositories that match a given pattern
- `--type <type>` finds PRs that update a specific type of package. Type values
  come from the branch names of Dependabot PRs, which have the form
  `dependabot/{package_type}/{package_name}-{version}`. For example "pip" or
  "npm_and_yarn".

## Limitations

This tool currently only fetches up to 100 PRs per run. To continue reviewing
after processing these, simply run the tool again.
